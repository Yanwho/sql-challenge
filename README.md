# sql-challenge

This challenge was surprisingly difficult.  I went in to it thinking it should be the easiest HW to date, but I had the hardest time with it for possibly the silliest of reasons.  I had a lockout of my GCP database instance that required many hours of phone support and eventually a loss of the database. #restart.
